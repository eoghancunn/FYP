The move to the pocket is a bit scary but after that itâ€™s just mint climbing and gear.

Getting established in the crack to the right is the crux, the key is to step right and up confidently and jam the crack (two or three jams) to the break.

Short but bold and quite rounded. A useful lip at the top helps for the top out.

wicked route.  technique will see you right up the crack without getting too tired.  loved the traverse back across and mantel up.  thought i might have got a bit more gear in after the mantle at this grade, but hay ho

Indeed pleasant, but take care not to finish direct - take a slight step right at the top, using a great knee-bar to reach over.

Amazing route, gave me a climbgasm. Dint see the high wires for the 2nd crux but just went for it anyway with my last pro dwindling away in the break at the start of the rightwards traverse. After the hard start the rest of the route feels quite eash IMHO!

Straight onto the arete from the ledge (with last decent gear at feet and poor, then no hands) looked desperate and way off for the grade. Went right to cracks then back left up the ramp to the arete. A poor route.

One of my favourite Stanage routes, I don't like cracks but this is Heaven

5a(?) moves to establish yourself in the groove and then 5b up the delicate groove.  very well protected but hard finish.

I found that it was hard to get any bomber gear in due to all the rusty wires. I used a 0.5 cam which was a bit under cammed on 2 of the cams and a size 1 next to it. I think it was ok but not as bomber as I would like. I also found that the moves up to the ledge were fairly thin but it was a hot day. Good route.

Hidden peg in first groove seems okay and can be backed up with a #1 nut and a micro. ~5b move to enter the first groove over a lonely shallowish cam.

The block at mid-height won't be there for long. Better not to sit down for a picnic at the bottom of this route for the time being.

Logical finish to RHCI.  Made all the more fun by the 40mph gusts of wind :-)

Play with it and you'll get it

did it two weeks ago ,pulled out one rusty wire and got a sma1l cam in lovely.1 star for aspect.
